# Stroke-Classifier-with-Imbalanced-Dataset-Using-Three-different-approaches-

1. Data cleaning and data preprocessing is done to convert the non-numerical categorical data to numerical data based on the characteristic(nominal or ordinal) of the feature.
2. The dataset is highly imbalanced, class weighted, downsampling and upsampling method is used to handle it.
3. Model selection is performed using cross validation, whereas the hyperparameter tuning is performed using Grid SearchCV.
4. Confusion matrix, ROC and AUC curve, classification report with different evaluation metrics is used to evalute the performance of the model.
